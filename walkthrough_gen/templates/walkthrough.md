# General Info

## Auto Battle

* Try to have Auto Battle running most of the time while in battle, because animations are faster when it’s on. If you have a character idle that you don’t want to waste a turn, enter Tech or Item menu, turn Auto Battle on to speed up the animations, then **turn it off** and exit the menu after it’s over.

## Exit menus

* Exit menus by pressing the menu button again. That can be used to skip healing items animations. That can also be used when you’re on equipment and need to use items, it’s faster to exit and enter again than go back to items.

## Exit shops

* Exit shops by pressing cancel twice. If you press more, you might toggle run. If you’re on equipment via a shop, you can also press the menu button to exit immediately.

## Menu inputs

* Don’t hold down to go to “accessory” for example. Press down 3 times because it’s faster.

## Controller config (via steam)

* Remap every button to its corresponding keyboard key config to reduce input lag  
* Set turbo to 14 ms
